![Version: 22.5.11](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-22.5.11-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square)

Easily deploy any application that conforms to the 12-factor application patterns. Kubernetes helps provide a
platform for many of the 12factor patterns. This chart attempts to help streamline the management of configuration,
log streams, and execution of administrative tasks.

In order for ingress addressing to work, there must be an `http` port exposed on the service in order for ingress to work. This can be configured on a per host-path definition or using the `portName` value.                                                                                                                                                   |
