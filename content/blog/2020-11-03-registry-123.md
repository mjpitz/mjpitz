DockerHub's [impending download rate limit][] presents an interesting challenge for some.
From hobbyists to open core ecosystems, projects are trying to find ways insulate their users.
For my projects, I chose to deploy a simple registry mirror.
One nice thing about this project is that the system is largely stateless (and cheap to run).
The `docker-registry` and `docker-auth` projects are horizontally scaleable.
The only stateful system you really need to manage is a cache (which isn't mission critical).
While [Harbor][] was appealing, it had a lot more overhead than what I needed.
In this post, I'll walk you through my deployment.

### Overview

Unlike many of my posts, I tried to externalize resources this time around instead of inlining them.
All the configuration used in this project can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/mjpitz/53e1d92cb0f2dc68e06e5c405f67e04f).
Below, you'll find an overview of the ecosystem. 
  
![system overview](/statics/img/2020-11-02-registry-overview.png) 

First, we'll deploy a simple [Redis][] cluster.
Once up and running, we'll deploy a read-only [registry][] mirror.
Finally, we'll add [token authentication][] to lock down repo access.

[registry]: https://docs.docker.com/registry/
[token authentication]: https://github.com/cesanta/docker_auth

### Configuration

Before getting into things, let's prepare our configuration.
These values will be used throughout the process and should be unique to your deployment.

```bash
# s3 configuration
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="???"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="???"
export S3_REGION=""
export S3_ENDPOINT=""
export S3_BUCKET=""

# obtained from https://hub.docker.com/settings/security
export DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=""
export DOCKERHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=""

# only allow images from mjpitz to be pulled 
export DOCKERHUB_ALLOWED="mjpitz"

export REDIS_PASSWORD=$(uuidgen)
```

In addition to that configuration, we will need to tap a couple [Helm][] repositories.
`stable` provides a well-supported `docker-registry` chart.
`bitnami` provides a couple `redis` charts sufficient for use with the registry.

```bash
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
```

[Helm]: https://helm.sh/

### Deploy a redis cluster

First things first, docker-registry supports caching blobs read from the S3 backend.
It supports two types of drivers: `inmemory` and `redis`.
For our deployment, we'll be using redis.
[Bitnami][] provides a `redis` and a `redis-cluster` chart.
The `redis` chart offers a primary-replica scheme.
A `redis-cluster` provides multiple primaries, improving the availability of writes.
For our sake, we're just going to use the `redis` chart.
All we need to do, is provide a password.

```bash
helm upgrade -i redis bitnami/redis --version 11.2.3 \
    --set password=${REDIS_PASSWORD}
```

[Bitnami]: https://bitnami.com/

### Deploy the registry

Once we have Redis and S3 ready, we should be able to deploy the registry.
For this, you will need my [01-docker-registry-values.yaml][] file from the gist.
This file configures the registry to:

* Store data in an S3 bucket
* Cache blobs in redis
* Run in a readonly mode (toggled by setting `configData.storage.maintenance.readonly.enabled=false`)
* Proxy requests to DockerHub (toggled by setting `configData.proxy=`)

All we need to do is plug in our values from earlier.

```bash
helm upgrade -i docker-registry stable/docker-registry --version 1.9.4 \
    -f 01-docker-registry-values.yaml \
    --set secrets.s3.accessKey=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} \
    --set secrets.s3.secretKey=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} \
    --set s3.region=${S3_REGION} \
    --set s3.regionEndpoint=${S3_ENDPOINT} \
    --set s3.bucket=${S3_BUCKET} \
    --set configData.redis.password=${REDIS_PASSWORD} \
    --set configData.proxy.username=${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME} \
    --set configData.proxy.password=${DOCKERHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}
```

Just like that, you should have a registry mirror up and running.
You can test this by port-forwarding to the pod and attempting to pull any image from DockerHub.
While being able to pull data from DockerHub is great, this _could_ be used maliciously.
For example, _someone_ could start pulling every image, for every tag on DockerHub.
This can result in bloating your image registry with images you didn't intend to host.

[01-docker-registry-values.yaml]: https://gist.github.com/mjpitz/53e1d92cb0f2dc68e06e5c405f67e04f#file-01-docker-registry-values-yaml

### Adding authentication

[docker_auth] was built to fill in the authentication (authn) and authorization (authz) gap for Docker.
It was one of the first systems to support Docker's token authentication flow.
The flow uses signed JWT tokens to verify identity claims by clients.
In order for it to work, we need to generate a private key and certificate.
Together, these are used to sign JWT token.
Using the commands below, we can generate the key and certificate.
Be sure to change the `-subj` line to something appropriate for your project.

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 5000 -nodes -x509 \
		-subj "/C=DE/ST=BW/L=Mannheim/O=ACME/CN=docker-auth" \
		-keyout tls.key \
		-out tls.crt

kubectl create secret tls auth-credentials --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key
```

Once our `auth-credentials` secret has been configured, we can deploy the docker-auth system.
For this example, we're going to restrict anonymous pulls to a DockerHub user or group of our choosing (`DOCKERHUB_ALLOWED`).
This means that users who are unauthenticated will only be allowed to pull images from these specified groups.
For this, you will need [02-docker-auth-values.yaml][] from the gist.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cesanta/docker_auth.git

helm upgrade -i docker-auth ./docker_auth/chart/docker-auth \
    -f 02-docker-auth-values.yaml \
    --set configmap.data.acl[0].match.name="${DOCKERHUB_ALLOWED}/*" 
```

Once running, you should be able to issue `/auth` requests against the pod.
The endpoint should return a pair of tokens that represent an unauthenticated user.

[docker_auth]: https://github.com/cesanta/docker_auth
[02-docker-auth-values.yaml]: https://gist.github.com/mjpitz/53e1d92cb0f2dc68e06e5c405f67e04f#file-02-docker-auth-values-yaml

### Deploy an ingress

Now that both docker-registry and docker-auth are running, let's connect them.
In kubernetes, an `Ingress` is a great way to provide application layer (L7) routing to applications.
It supports both host and path based routing.
In this post we'll configure the paths of an ingress to route to their appropriate backend.
`/auth`, `/google_auth`, and `/github_auth` will all route to the docker-auth project.
`/v2` will route to the docker-registry project.
To do this, we will need [03-ingress.yaml][] from the gist.
Be sure to change the `host` to your project domain.

```bash
kubectl apply -f 03-ingress.yaml
```

Once applied, you should be able to start working with the ingress definition.
Requests to `/auth` should resolve from docker-auth.
Requests to `/v2/_catalog` should resolve from docker-registry.
Remember, some annotations on the ingress are specific to my tech stack.
You may need to find the equivalent for yours. 

[03-ingress.yaml]: https://gist.github.com/mjpitz/53e1d92cb0f2dc68e06e5c405f67e04f#file-03-ingress-yaml

### Connecting docker-registry to docker-auth

Now that the client can speak to docker-auth and docker-registry, we can connect the two.
To do so, the docker-registry needs access to the certificate used by docker-auth.
This is used to validate the JWT token.
We can update `docker-registry-values.yaml` to volume mount the file in.
Then, we just need to point the `auth` block of configuration at the proper endpoints.
Below is a diff of the changes needed to add auth.  

```diff
    encrypt: false
    securet: true
  
+ extraVolumeMounts:
+   - name: auth
+     mountPath: "/etc/docker-auth/ssl/"
+     readOnly: true
+ 
+ extraVolumes:
+   - name: auth
+     secret:
+       secretName: auth-credentials
+ 
  # see https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/
  configData:
+   auth:
+     token:
+       realm: "https://ocr.sh/auth"
+       service: "ocr.sh"
+       issuer: "My Auth" # must match issuer from docker-auth
+       rootcertbundle: /etc/docker-auth/ssl/tls.crt
+ 
    http:
      addr: :5000
      debug:
```

Alternatively, you can grab an updated copy from [04-docker-registry-values-yaml][] in the gist.
Remember to set your `realm`, `service`, `issuer` and `rootcertbundle` appropriately.

```bash
helm upgrade -i docker-registry stable/docker-registry --version 1.9.4 \
    -f 04-docker-registry-values.yaml \
    --set secrets.s3.accessKey=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} \
    --set secrets.s3.secretKey=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} \
    --set s3.region=${S3_REGION} \
    --set s3.regionEndpoint=${S3_ENDPOINT} \
    --set s3.bucket=${S3_BUCKET} \
    --set configData.redis.password=${REDIS_PASSWORD} \
    --set configData.proxy.username=${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME} \
    --set configData.proxy.password=${DOCKERHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}
```

Once your release has been upgraded, the registry should deny any requests for images outside of your configured group.
For example, I wound up with `ocr.sh` for my projects domain.
I configured `DOCKERHUB_ALLOWED` to only allow unauthenticated users to pull `depscloud/*`.
This allows my project consumers to continue to use my product without being rate limited by GitHub.
Under the hood, all requests to DockerHub are authenticated.
In addition to that, I have tight control over what repositories I allow to be pulled through my proxy.
