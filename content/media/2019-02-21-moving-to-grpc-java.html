<p>
  Historically, Indeed has used Boxcar (Indeed’s proprietary framework) to build distributed systems.
  Over the last year, we have been shifting several of our systems to use gRPC.
  The first question product teams often ask is "How does gRPC compare to Boxcar?"
  In this presentation, I put the two frameworks head to head and present the results.
  I show how my team established some common workloads and gathered metrics to better inform other engineers.
  We learned a lot about how to optimize the gRPC Java library when performing this analysis.
  In closing, I present the lessons that we learned performance tuning gRPC services and how you can leverage this information for your own services.
