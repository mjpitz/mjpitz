#### Languages

[Go]: https://go.dev
[Rust]: https://rust-lang.org

When it comes to programming languages, I fall into the camp of "use the right tool for the job". Since starting my
career on the front-end development side of the world, I'm fluent with JavaScript, NodeJS, TypeScript, and many other
variants we've seen throughout the years. Since then, I've picked up a few more systems programming languages, including
[Go][] and [Rust][].

#### Observability, Operations, and Intelligence

[cognative]: https://github.com/mjpitz/cognative
[ClickHouse]: https://clickhouse.com
[OpenTelemetry]: https://opentelemetry.io
[Grafana]: https://grafana.com

I recently adopted [cognative][], a simplified stack that I've been developing to reduce the technical requirements for
smaller organizations to own their own Business Intelligence and Operations (what I'm calling BIO). It does this by
collapsing the traditional "Business Intelligence" and "Operations" verticals into a single, common stack that offers a
centralized location for ALL your information.

Cognative is composed of three systems: [ClickHouse][], [OpenTelemetry][], and [Grafana][].

#### Runtime and Orchestration

[Kubernetes]: https://kubernetes.io
[k3s]: https://k3s.io
[Aurae]: https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae

Over the last 6 years, I've accumulated a lot of experience operating [Kubernetes][] clusters in production, overseeing
large scale migrations to the platform, as well as having hands-on experience deploying and maintaining systems running
on it. For smaller projects where a cloud provider may not be available, I enjoy the [k3s][] ecosystem. Outside
Kubernetes, I'm really interested in going a bit deeper on the [Aurae][] project to explore it's potential for
small-board systems.

#### Deployment

[ArgoCD]: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
[Terraform]: https://terraform.io
[Helm]: https://helm.sh

Deploying systems to production is always fun. I have been a big fan of the [ArgoCD][] project for a while but found it
to be a bit overkill for the cases I'm in these days. For now, I just rely on [Terraform][] to drive [Helm][] releases,
but look forward to being able to leverage ArgoCD once again.
