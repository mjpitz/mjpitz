![Mya on the ice.](/img/hockey.jpg)

I fell in love with hockey when I first watched my brother play in grade one. I remember being heartbroken after finding
out the period for registration had ended and that I would have to wait till next year. But I didn't that stop me from
going to the first open skate I could. I quickly took to skating and before I knew it, we were registering for hockey
the next season. I hopped between travel and house teams growing up, tried out for high school, played club in college,
and now I spend a good amount of time playing in adult leagues. In Texas, I typically play with A and B1 players.
