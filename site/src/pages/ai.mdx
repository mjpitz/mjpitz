**Last Modified:** January 26, 2025

Before getting into how I use artificial intelligence (AI) on my website, I first want to call out that I do _ALL_ of
my writing myself. Since I first started writing technically in 2014, I have never been comfortable working with
ghostwriters or have other people write / speak on my behalf. So why would I treat AI any different? I don't believe AI
is as trustworthy as a ghostwriter would be, so I've been very selective about how it gets incorporated into my work.

### Technology

I am fortunate enough to have experimented around with a number of different technologies and have sufficient resources
on my local development machine to be able to run a number of different models. While the cloud hosted solutions offer
a lot of value, I don't have an infinite amount of money to throw at dozens of different solutions.

For a short period of time, I paid for [MidJourney][] to generate images but recently stopped since I no longer have a
strong need for them. In the future, I may resume this service but for now it's served its purpose.

For anything related to text, I leverage [Ollama][] and [Enchanted][] locally.

### Editing Process

I predominantly use AI to help edit my own writing. This includes:

- Exploring alternative wordings for sentences to reduce complexity
- Iterating on statements to improve clarity and strength
- Identifying problematic areas of articles that may need further detail
- Turning text into speech when proofreading articles
