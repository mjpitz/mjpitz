I started programming over 2 decades ago. At 15, I started my first website development company, selling services to
local small companies that wanted to establish an online presence. Eventually, I found myself in college pursuing a
degree in Software Engineering, a minor in mathematics, and a specialization in artificial intelligence. When I was 22,
I started my first start up with a few friends. We built an online resumÃ© development tool so jobseekers can better
maintain their content over time. With over 20 years of experience, I've worked across a variety of organizations.

Outside of work, I'm an avid [hockey][] player, intermediate pianist, a parent to both humans and pets, and I volunteer
for a state-wide search and rescue organization. Something you may notice about my site is that it uses a hyper-legible
font. I often struggle to interpret characters when reading, especially on screens. To make my life easier, I favor
screen readers for consuming text content (including my own).

#### Passion Projects

[Raspberry Pi]: https://raspberrypi.com
[Fujifilm X-T20]: https://a.co/d/10mKXwR

In general, small-board computer projects (such as the [Raspberry Pi][]) make me really excited about possible
opportunities. I've always enjoyed tinkering with things throughout my life and the Raspberry Pi is a great tool to do
just that. And finally, I like to take photos for the projects I'm working on (especially when hardware is involved). So
I recently bought a [Fujifilm X-T20][] and have been absolutely loving it.
