I'm an Engineering Director at [CrabNebula][], one of the organizations behind [Tauri][]. Programming started as a hobby
for me over 20 years ago. After some time, I decided to get a degree in Software Engineering, with a computational
mathematics a specialization in artificial intelligence. While I've worked at a couple larger organizations, I really
enjoy working at and on start-ups.

One thing you'll notice about my site is that it uses a hyper-legible font. I often struggle to differentiate between
characters, especially on screens. As a result, I use hyper-legible fonts and screen-readers to make my life a bit
easier.

Outside of work, I'm an avid [hockey][] player, piano player, a parent to both humans and pets, and I volunteer for a
state-wide search and rescue organization. Like many, I struggle with a wide range of mental health issues and rely
heavily on screen readers. Over the last few months, I've been out on [FMLA][], but am excited and enthusiastic to
return back to work.

#### Passion Projects

[Raspberry Pi]: https://raspberrypi.com
[Fujifilm X-T20]: https://a.co/d/10mKXwR

In general, small-board computer projects (such as the [Raspberry Pi][]) make me really excited about possible
opportunities. I've always enjoyed tinkering with things throughout my life and the Raspberry Pi is a great tool to do
just that. And finally, I like to take photos for the projects I'm working on (especially when hardware is involved). So
I recently bought a [Fujifilm X-T20][] and have been absolutely loving it.
