[Jsonnet] is a powerful data templating language. It extends JSON with variables, conditionals, functions, imports and
more. As an engineer who never touched the technology before, I often struggled to understand it. In this post, I share
my experience learning Jsonnet and my thoughts behind developing a starter.

With my departure from Indeed, coworkers asked that I provide monitoring for my open source project. As I searched
around looking for examples to follow, I quickly discovered Jsonnet. While it appeared to be a powerful tool, I couldn't
find any good starters for it. Many existing projects out there were great references, but lacked set up and direction.
To keep things simple, I started with the [kubernetes-mixin] project structure.

### Fighting through the trough

When I learn something new, I often go through the [Hype Cycle]. At first, there are high expectations for what I'll be
able to do with a given tool. After gaining some familiarity, I dig in. Then, the trough of disillusionment hits. Here,
I spend most of my time learning (often hands on). While here, I try not to expect anything to work the first time. Only
that I'm making progress, both iteratively and visibly. Eventually, I reach the plateau of productivity. At this point,
I'm familiar enough with the semantics and sharp edges to be productive.

With Jsonnet, I found the trough to be longer than I initially expected. Like many languages, issues with files were
identified by line and character numbers. Where I ran into more problems was at the command-line tool / language
interface. There were several moments where the output of the jsonnet CLI stumped me. At one point, I pushed up my
changes and gave it a break. After some needed rest, I was able to track down the issue and was back on track. (Granted,
I was attempting to build **_four_** [Grafana] dashboards my first time through.)

_References were key_ to making it through the trough. Without them, I would still be working through the pull request.
They can provide great examples, reference points, and even ideas on what you should monitor.

### Composition

[deps.cloud] is an open source project of mine that helps track, monitor, and connect project dependencies across
languages and toolchains. I built it as a [successor to a previous system] I implemented at Indeed. Unlike it's
predecessor, deps.cloud supports many different languages. It implements a common set of [gRPC] microservices that can
be swapped out or reconfigured. For example, https://api.deps.cloud is backed by a read-only version of the `tracker`
process (for now). As the operator of that service, I might want a dedicated dashboard or set of alerts for that
deployment.

Remember, iterative and visible progress. When I started the dashboards, I used a similar layout to the kubernetes-mixin
project. Once I had something working and checked in, I started to look at how I could improve it. For one, I found
their format didn't support the composition model I was hoping for. It used a few tools like [jsonnet-bundler] which
allows for package management. With a few modifications, I was able to get a more modular structure in place.

### jsonnet-monitoring-starter

I created the [jsonnet-monitoring-starter] repository to help others get started with monitoring tools in a declarative
way. Each service in your system is given space for alerts, dashboards, recording rules, and default configuration.

```
└── service-template
    ├── config.libsonnet
    ├── mixin.libsonnet
    ├── alerts
    │   ├── alert-template.libsonnet
    │   └── alerts.libsonnet
    ├── dashboards
    │   ├── dashboard-template.libsonnet
    │   └── dashboards.libsonnet
    └── rules
        ├── rule-template.libsonnet
        └── rules.libsonnet
```

`mixin.libsonnet` allows services to be composed into higher level abstractions. This is done using the `import`
directive in jsonnet. For an example of how this is done, see any `mixin.libsonnet` file in the repository. Finally, the
starter provides some boilerplate for generating output files.

```
└── pkg
    ├── alerts.jsonnet
    ├── dashboards.jsonnet
    └── rules.jsonnet
```

To see this approach in action, stop on over at [depscloud/deploy] and take a look at the [monitoring] setup there.
