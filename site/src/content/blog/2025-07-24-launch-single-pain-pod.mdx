    During OpenSource Summit North America 2025, Josh and I co-presented our thoughts on unifying organizational data
    (business intelligence, observability, and security) under one single pane of glass. Our talk was the culmination of
    a series of discussions that we had during the course of 2024 and continue to have in 2025. Building on our 
    collaboration and dynamic, we decided to start a new limited series podcast called Single Pain.

During [OpenSource Summit North America 2025][ossna2025], [Josh][joshlee] and I co-presented our thoughts on unifying
organizational data (business intelligence, observability, and security) under one single pane of glass. Our talk was
the culmination of a series of discussions that we had during the course of 2024 and continue to have in 2025. Building
on our collaboration and dynamic, we decided to start a new limited series podcast called Single Pain.

**Schedule**

_Episode 1 - AI Fundamentals - Now Available!_

In our first episode, Josh and I discuss our experiences using AI for code generation and focus our conversation on
[Cline][] (a popular VSCode extension) and [Claude Code][] (a leading terminal-based solution). We talk about the
benefits and trade-offs to LLMs performing some of this work as well as several pitfalls.

_Episode 2 - Workflows & One-shots - Tomorrow!_

In this week's episode, we explore AI's ability to produce clean, well-structured data through the use of
workflow-based automation tools. Using a personal database, we'll integrate solutions like [n8n][], [MCP's][], and
Claude Desktop's capabilities.

_Episode 3 - Agents & Assistants - August 8th_

I've heard it multiple times… “is chat the only interface you need?” While I strongly disagree with this notion, I do
see value in having an intelligent assistant helping you along the way. In this episode, we'll explore augmenting
existing interfaces to information with chat tools.

_Episode 4 - Homelab & Nix - August 15th_

[Nix][] has been on my list to learn for a long time now. Back in the fall, I was exploring using it to build and
package my own operating system for edge devices but didn't get into it enough. In this episode, Josh will take me
through the world of Nix and his experience working with it and AI together.

_Episode 5 - Modern 12 Factor - August 22nd_

Earlier this year, I started to think about how [12Factor][] considerations have changed since they were first
published in 2011. Written in the hay-day of microservices and small, independent git repos for version management, how
have these decisions held up in the modern day? In this episode, Josh and I step through the 12Factor pattern and
discuss the things we would change given our experience and AI needs.
