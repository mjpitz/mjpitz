        <description>This paper details a solution to attributing cost across common infrastructure. The original target for the solution was a hybrid-cloud infrastructure. This led to a comprehensive, yet flexible design. As a result, its concepts are generic and support both cloud and non-cloud ecosystems. The goal is to provide a single view into spend across platforms. It needs to support a large variety of use cases, from leaders analyzing spend to teams understanding the cost of systems they consume.</description>
