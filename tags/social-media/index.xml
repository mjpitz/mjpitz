        <description>&lt;p&gt;Two months ago, I decided to try an experiment. I took my Twitter account that I reserved back in 2012 with hundreds of
followers and deactivated it. Before deactivation, I created a new account and invited folks to follow me there. This
not only gave me a fresh start, but it also gave me a chance to curate who I follow and who I allow to follow me a bit
better than I had before. After having it up for a few months, I finally decided to deactivate it. For good. Here&amp;rsquo;s why,
and how my life has been better because of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
