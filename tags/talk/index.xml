  Similar to my talk on gRPC Java but with more of a focus on the addition of the service mesh.
&lt;/p&gt;

  Historically, Indeed has used Boxcar (Indeedâ€™s proprietary framework) to build distributed systems.
  Over the last year, we have been shifting several of our systems to use gRPC.
  The first question product teams often ask is &#34;How does gRPC compare to Boxcar?&#34;
  In this presentation, I put the two frameworks head to head and present the results.
  I show how my team established some common workloads and gathered metrics to better inform other engineers.
  We learned a lot about how to optimize the gRPC Java library when performing this analysis.
  In closing, I present the lessons that we learned performance tuning gRPC services and how you can leverage this information for your own services.
&lt;/p&gt;
