      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indeed had an internal blog series called &amp;ldquo;Show us Your Setup.&amp;rdquo;
It was a great way to get an idea of others workspaces, the equipment they use, and software they run.
Recently, I had noticed a few folks doing a walk through of their equipment.
In this post, I will show and walk through my setup.
I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the things I like, and the things I don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
