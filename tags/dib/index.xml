      <description>&lt;p&gt;Historically, my blog has largely been focused on technology.
This was because of where I was in my career.
And yet, my career doesn&amp;rsquo;t solely reside in tech.
As a transgender individual, I frequently need to correct peoples use of my and other peoples pronouns.
Whenever a transgender person needs to correct someone, we pay an emotional tax.
While it might seem small at first, you need to consider that individuals full experience.
In this post, I share techniques I found effective at getting better with pronouns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
