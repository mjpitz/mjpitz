The Status library enables dynamic health checks and monitoring of system dependencies.
In this post, we will show how to add health checks to your applications.

LevelDB is an implementation of a log structured merge tree (LSMTree) provided by Google.
This data structure aimed at providing a high write throughput.
When attempting to use LevelDB, I found it difficult to track down supported libraries in different languages.

It allowed me to create seamless environments between both my desktop and portable workstation.
The tooling did this by allowing you to resolve container names as hosts in your web browser.

short-circuiting code paths of your application;
removing a single application instance from a data center load balancer;
and removing an entire data center from rotation at the DNS level.

Traditionally, in order to produce an arm image, you need an arm device to do the build on.
As a result, most projects wind up missing arm support.

it also gave me a chance to curate who I follow and who I allow to follow me a bit better than I had before. After
having it up for a few months, I finally decided to deactivate it. For good. Here&apos;s why, and how my life has been
better because of it.

can cost a lot of money. In this post, we’ll take a deeper look into the time commitment and cost for peer one-on-ones.

The investment I made in me.
Since the end of May, I&apos;ve been on a journey piecing my puzzle back together. It was not a decision I took lightly and
required great sacrifice along the way.

theme throughout the last few years. From going no-contact with some family members, to saying goodbye to several key
relationships in my life, to the death of a chosen family member.

Specifically, I want to
share a story of a project I worked on back in the Summer of 2016 while at Indeed. It&apos;s a great example of where
working smarter, and not harder, led to less hands-on work, and being able to spend my day playing pool (billiards).

We often spend our time
together playing board games, playing piano, watching movies, among other activities. Recently, I&apos;ve been watching
clips from the UK game show &quot;Countdown&quot; and found myself really enjoying the math portion. In this post, I discuss how
my child and I came up with a way to play this game using a single deck of cards.

life. I wanted to say something at the time, but wasn&apos;t in a place where I could. For years, I&apos;ve struggled with an
eating disorder that I didn&apos;t know was there. It&apos;s claimed months of time from my work over the years, and has sent me
to the emergency room on more than one occasion. Today, I share the many other ways a pervasive eating disorder impacts
my life on an ongoing basis.

market. At my previous company, my infrastructure engineer spent a good amount of time fighting with the LGTP stack.
After work, I found myself venting to a friend about how unnecessarily complex the open source ecosystem has become.
Having worked at startups for the last 4 years, I&apos;ve seen just how hard it can be to deploy a comprehensive
observability and business intelligence solution. In this post, I&apos;ll discuss my rationale for abandoning many popular
stacks out there today in favor of one of my own design.

In this post, I wanted to
share more about my journey and the challenges I’ve faced along the way, including finding a non-faith based group. Most
people refer to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), but don’t understand just how religious (specifically Christian/Catholic)
those groups can be. While I’m still quite spiritual, this approach doesn’t work for me and many others.

to meet, connect, and share with one another. This year was my first year in attendance and there were many things about
this conference that I liked better when compared to many others. I made a lot of new friends and connections around the
startup scene in Austin and learned a lot about sizing markets and strategies to approach fundraising. In this post, I
share a bit about my experience, the sessions I chose to attend, and some of my key takeaways from the conference.

(business intelligence, observability, and security) under one single pane of glass. Our talk was the culmination of
a series of discussions that we had during the course of 2024 and continue to have in 2025. Building on our 
collaboration and dynamic, we decided to start a new limited series podcast called Single Pain.
