    <p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve found myself using <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> for more of the projects that I work on.  Redis can be used in a variety of
ways. It provides functionality for queueing, set operations, bitmaps, streams, and so much more. Yet, most of my
experience with Redis has been as a best-effort cache. Since it&rsquo;s become a staple in my development, I figured it would
be good to brush up on its operations.</p>
<p>In this post, I dive into the variety of ways Redis can be deployed. I&rsquo;ll cover the benefits, tradeoffs, and even some
uses for each deployment. Finally, I&rsquo;ll describe the deployment that I recently put together.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-redis">What is Redis?</h2>
<p>Redis is an open-source, in-memory database licensed under the BSD license. It has built-in replication, common eviction
strategies, and even different levels of on-disk persistence. Redis also supports <a href="https://redis.io/topics/modules-intro">modules</a>, which makes it easy to
plug in new functionality and interact with native data types. For example, the <a href="http://redisgraph.io/">RedisGraph</a> module extends Redis by
providing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database">graph database</a> capabilities. Due to the variety of data structures and its flexibility, it&rsquo;s no wonder
Redis has become as <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2020/11/18/cncf-end-user-technology-radar-database-storage-november-2020/">popular</a> as it has.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-redis-be-deployed">How can Redis be deployed?</h2>
<p>One of the big benefits to Redis is that it can be deployed in a variety of ways. We won&rsquo;t dive into every deployment,
but we will focus on the common patterns.</p>
<h3 id="replicated">Replicated</h3>
<p>The easiest deployment of Redis is a replicated architecture. In this deployment, Redis has a single, primary write
point called a &ldquo;master&rdquo;. Any data written to this primary propagates to replicas asynchronously. The diagram below
depicts how an application may interact with this deployment.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2021-04-22-redis-replicated.jpg" alt="replicated diagram"></p>
<p>While the deployment is rather straightforward, there are a few things that we need to keep in mind. First, applications
need to be able to track read-only and read-write connections. They could use a single connection, but that likely means
that the primary handles every request. By using a single connection, your application makes no use of the replicas that
you have in place. Second, this deployment has a single point of failure, the primary node. Should the primary node
fail, applications can no longer write data to Redis.</p>
<p>This deployment works well for offline population. For example, maybe you have a background task that&rsquo;s responsible for
populating the cache. Meanwhile, your web service knows about the replicas and actively reads from them. Should the
primary crash, your background process can simply wait for it to return.</p>
<h3 id="using-sentinel">Using Sentinel</h3>
<p>To help alleviate the single primary node in the previous deployment, Redis provides Sentinel. Sentinel is a separate
process that determines when a given primary node is no longer available. It does this by using a quorum to vote on
member availability. When a member becomes unavailable, Sentinel is able to elect a new primary for the cluster. The
diagram below depicts how an application may interact with this deployment.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2021-04-22-redis-sentinel.jpg" alt="sentinel diagram"></p>
<p>Similar to the last deployment, this approach has some downsides. When a client wants to write data to a Sentinel
cluster, they first need to consult the Sentinel process. Sentinel reports to callers who the current primary in the
cluster is. Then, clients will call the primary to write the data. As a result, clients need to be aware they are
talking to a Sentinel cluster. This often requires additional configuration that few projects support.</p>
<p>Another risk to this deployment is a potential split-brain state during upgrades or node failures. A split-brain state
happens when two nodes cannot come to an agreement. This case is less likely if you manage Sentinel deployments
separately from Redis. If you run them in the same pod or on the same host, the likelihood of this scenario increases.
To illustrate let us consider the above example.</p>
<ol>
<li>Suppose we upgrade our cluster and <code>redis-0</code> is taken down.</li>
<li>Sentinels detect that the pod is no longer available and start figuring out a new primary.</li>
<li>The sentinel for <code>redis-1</code> votes that <code>redis-2</code> should be the new primary.</li>
<li>The sentinel for <code>redis-2</code> votes that <code>redis-1</code> should be the new primary.</li>
<li>With a quorum of <code>2</code>, the instances are unable to come to consensus.</li>
<li>Steps 2 through 5 repeat until the instances reach a quorum.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, this is how <a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts">Bitnami</a> configures the deployment of Sentinel in their <code>redis</code> Helm chart. While
split-brains <em>can</em> occur, they may not be as common as you may think. Still, it&rsquo;s something you need to account for in
your deployment.</p>
<h3 id="redis-cluster">Redis Cluster</h3>
<p>Redis Cluster is popular amongst those using Redis for a large amount of data. It shards data across the instances in
the cluster, thus reducing the resource requirements of each individual node. Redis does this by hashing the provided
key into a slot. Slots are distributed across the primaries in the cluster, often in chunks. The diagram below
illustrates how an application might interact with members of a Redis Cluster.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2021-04-22-redis-cluster.jpg" alt="cluster diagram"></p>
<p>Similar to the Sentinel deployment, applications need to be aware they are speaking to a Redis Cluster. This is due to
how Redis Cluster handles its sharding. Clients are responsible for hashing keys to determine which slot they write to.
Then, clients write to the instance responsible for the associated slot. This will allow clients to perform a subset of
operations, even in the event of a partial cluster outage.</p>
<h3 id="clustering-with-envoy">Clustering with Envoy</h3>
<p>An alternative to using Redis Cluster would be to cluster using Envoy. <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/other_protocols/redis">Envoy</a> is a well-known, well-supported,
network proxy open-sourced by Lyft. It supports many protocols including HTTP, gRPC, MongoDB, Redis, and more. When
using Envoy to cluster instances, envoy handles partitioning the keyspace on behalf of Redis. This means the underlying
Redis instances <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> have clustering enabled.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2021-04-22-redis-envoy.jpg" alt="envoy diagram"></p>
<p>In this deployment, Envoy favors availability and partition tolerance over consistency. This makes it ideal for a
best-effort cache, but not great for more stateful systems. You might consider setting an LRU eviction policy for Redis
to ensure stale, unused data is pruned first. One nice thing about this deployment is that clients can speak to any
<code>envoy</code> instance in the cluster. This drastically simplifies the logic on the callers' end when compared to Redis
Cluster.</p>
<p><em>2022-03-21 Edit</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written up a <a href="/charts/">Redis Helm Chart</a> that makes it easy to deploy a Redis cluster using this pattern. Instead of
running Envoy as a sidecar to the Redis server, client applications must embed it into their own application. My helm
chart provides a simple function for doing so. For a reference on how to do this, see the <a href="https://github.com/mjpitz/mjpitz/blob/main/charts/registry/templates/deployment.yaml#L84-L86">Registry Helm Chart</a> as an
example.</p>
<h2 id="my-deployment">My deployment</h2>
<p>While these approaches can work great, I often found myself wanting something a little different. Ideally, I wanted a
deployment that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves the availability of the replicated deployment</li>
<li>Improves the stability of the sentinel deployment</li>
<li>Maintains the simplicity of the replicated deployment</li>
<li>Maintains the consistency of the Redis deployments</li>
</ul>
<p>Such a deployment would improve task and queue-based systems like <a href="https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/index.html">Celery</a> in python or <a href="https://github.com/RichardKnop/machinery/">Machinery</a> in go. Payloads
in these systems tend to be small, relatively short-lived, and/or backed up elsewhere. This means we rarely need to
shard data across nodes.</p>
<p>As I contemplated how to do this, I kept my runtime environment in mind. Kubernetes provides many capabilities to
engineers. For example, adding leader election to a system is relatively easy to do in Go. The <code>client-go</code> library
provides a pre-built <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/tree/master/tools/leaderelection"><code>leaderelection</code></a> package. This can automate watching a <code>Lease</code> for changes and periodically
attempting to claim leadership. This had given me an idea for a sidecar.</p>
<ol>
<li>The sidecar would use the Lease API to determine leadership in the cluster.</li>
<li>When an election occurs, the sidecar is responsible for updating the topology of the Redis cluster.
<ol>
<li>Each sidecar acts independently, removing the need for coordination beyond the initial election.</li>
<li>Each sidecar takes appropriate steps to handle the change in leadership gracefully.
<ul>
<li>The current leader pauses writes and waits for the newly elected leader to catch up.</li>
<li>The newly elected leader waits for syncs to complete before attempting to promote itself to leader.</li>
<li>All other followers swap over to replicating from the new leader.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the topology of the cluster has been updated, the sidecar of the newly elected updates a Kubernetes <code>Endpoint</code>.
<ul>
<li>This Endpoint can be used by clients to guarantee requests get sent to the leader.</li>
<li>A separate service can be used to allow reads to any node in the cluster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Such a system can be seen below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2021-04-22-redis-mya.jpg" alt="mya diagram"></p>
<p>A nice thing about this deployment is that the mitigation techniques are similar to that of the sentinel deployment.
While we aren&rsquo;t using the sentinel to perform the election process, we are doing more or less the same thing. A benefit
to this deployment over sentinel is that we remove the call to discover the current leader. Instead, clients get a
stable address they can dial and always reach a leader, even during rolling upgrades.</p>
<p>In the few tests I ran, I had seen failover times of 6 to 10 seconds. Definitely still working out some tuning, but all
in all, I&rsquo;m satisfied with how it came out. For now, I&rsquo;m going to keep the project closed source. If you&rsquo;re interested
in chatting through this a bit more feel free to reach out.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for checking in. I know it&rsquo;s been a while. I hope you learned something while you were here. Thanks for
reading!</p>
