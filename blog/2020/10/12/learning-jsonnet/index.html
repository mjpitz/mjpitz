    <p><a href="https://jsonnet.org/">Jsonnet</a> is a powerful data templating language.
It extends JSON with variables, conditionals, functions, imports and more.
As an engineer who never touched the technology before, I often struggled to understand it.
In this post, I share my experience learning Jsonnet and my thoughts behind developing a starter.</p>
<p>With my departure from Indeed, coworkers asked that I provide monitoring for my open source project.
As I searched around looking for examples to follow, I quickly discovered Jsonnet.
While it appeared to be a powerful tool, I couldn&rsquo;t find any good starters for it.
Many existing projects out there were great references, but lacked set up and direction.
To keep things simple, I started with the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-monitoring/kubernetes-mixin">kubernetes-mixin</a> project structure.</p>
<h3 id="fighting-through-the-trough">Fighting through the trough</h3>
<p>When I learn something new, I often go through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">Hype Cycle</a>.
At first, there are high expectations for what I&rsquo;ll be able to do with a given tool.
After gaining some familiarity, I dig in.
Then, the trough of disillusionment hits.
Here, I spend most of my time learning (often hands on).
While here, I try not to expect anything to work the first time.
Only that I&rsquo;m making progress, both iteratively and visibly.
Eventually, I reach the plateau of productivity.
At this point,  I&rsquo;m familiar enough with the semantics and sharp edges to be productive.</p>
<p>With Jsonnet, I found the trough to be longer than I initially expected.
Like many languages, issues with files were identified by line and character numbers.
Where I ran into more problems was at the command-line tool / language interface.
There were several moments where the output of the jsonnet CLI stumped me.
At one point, I pushed up my changes and gave it a break.
After some needed rest, I was able to track down the issue and was back on track.
(Granted, I was attempting to build <strong><em>four</em></strong> <a href="https://grafana.com">Grafana</a> dashboards my first time through.)</p>
<p><em>References were key</em> to making it through the trough.
Without them, I would still be working through the pull request.
They can provide great examples, reference points, and even ideas on what you should monitor.</p>
<h3 id="composition">Composition</h3>
<p><a href="https://deps.cloud/">deps.cloud</a> is an open source project of mine that helps track, monitor, and connect project dependencies across languages and toolchains.
I built it as a <a href="https://mjpitz.com/blog/2020/01/24/building-depscloud/">successor to a previous system</a> I implemented at Indeed.
Unlike it&rsquo;s predecessor, deps.cloud supports many different languages.
It implements a common set of <a href="https://grpc.io">gRPC</a> microservices that can be swapped out or reconfigured.
For example, <a href="https://api.deps.cloud">https://api.deps.cloud</a> is backed by a read-only version of the <code>tracker</code> process (for now).
As the operator of that service, I might want a dedicated dashboard or set of alerts for that deployment.</p>
<p>Remember, iterative and visible progress.
When I started the dashboards, I used a similar layout to the kubernetes-mixin project.
Once I had something working and checked in, I started to look at how I could improve it.
For one, I found their format didn&rsquo;t support the composition model I was hoping for.
It used a few tools like [jsonnet-bundler] which allows for package management.
With a few modifications, I was able to get a more modular structure in place.</p>
<h3 id="jsonnet-monitoring-starter">jsonnet-monitoring-starter</h3>
<p>I created the <a href="https://github.com/mjpitz/jsonnet-monitoring-starter">jsonnet-monitoring-starter</a> repository to help others get started with monitoring tools in a declarative way.
Each service in your system is given space for alerts, dashboards, recording rules, and default configuration.</p>
<pre><code>└── service-template
    ├── config.libsonnet
    ├── mixin.libsonnet
    ├── alerts
    │   ├── alert-template.libsonnet
    │   └── alerts.libsonnet
    ├── dashboards
    │   ├── dashboard-template.libsonnet
    │   └── dashboards.libsonnet
    └── rules
        ├── rule-template.libsonnet
        └── rules.libsonnet
</code></pre><p><code>mixin.libsonnet</code> allows services to be composed into higher level abstractions.
This is done using the <code>import</code> directive in jsonnet.
For an example of how this is done, see any <code>mixin.libsonnet</code> file in the repository.
Finally, the starter provides some boilerplate for generating output files.</p>
<pre><code>└── pkg
    ├── alerts.jsonnet
    ├── dashboards.jsonnet
    └── rules.jsonnet
</code></pre><p>To see this approach in action, stop on over at <a href="https://github.com/depscloud/deploy">depscloud/deploy</a> and take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/depscloud/deploy/tree/main/monitoring">monitoring</a> setup there.</p>
