    <p>Indeed had an internal blog series called &ldquo;Show us Your Setup.&rdquo;
It was a great way to get an idea of others workspaces, the equipment they use, and software they run.
Recently, I had noticed a few folks doing a walk through of their equipment.
In this post, I will show and walk through my setup.
I&rsquo;ll discuss the things I like, and the things I don&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="desktop-hardware">Desktop hardware</h3>
<p><img src="/statics/img/2020-10-19-desktop.jpeg" alt="desktop"></p>
<p>My desk is an <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-home">Autonomous SmartDesk2</a>.
Early in my career, I hopped on the standing desk kick and loved it.
This desk has been the best one yet.
With 4 programmable settings, I&rsquo;m able to choose between a height that works for the day.
If you enjoy standing and are looking for a high quality desk, take a look at this one.
Since I stand often, I also have an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073BQKHPR">anti-fatigue floor mat</a>.
This helps reduce stress and pain on joints when I&rsquo;m standing.</p>
<p>The thing I like about my setup is that it&rsquo;s hot-swappable.
I attach everything through a single <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YZ48HCT">Anker USB C Hub</a>.
At the end of the week, I can unplug my work laptop, and connect my personal one.
I don&rsquo;t need to reconfigure anything.
Just plug and play.</p>
<p>This is only possible because of my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dell-P2418D-23-8-16-Monitor/dp/B074MMR1V3">Dell P2418D</a> monitor.
It provides additional USB ports that I&rsquo;m able to connect my peripherals to.
Specifically, my <a href="https://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/snowball/">Blue snowball</a> microphone and <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c920s-pro-hd-webcam.960-001257.html">Logitech c920s</a> webcam.
I&rsquo;ve been told on some occasions that the snowball mic is too quiet.
It&rsquo;s rather sensitive to the direction that you&rsquo;re speaking.
So make sure it&rsquo;s well positioned.</p>
<p>While I only got the webcam today, I&rsquo;ve been a long time user of Logitech.
In college, I built web-based video software for <a href="https://www.rit.edu/ntid/">NTID</a> at <a href="https://www.rit.edu">RIT</a>.
We had tons of webcams from different vendors.
The best one we used by far was a Logitech 9xx model.
So when I started to look around, I naturally gravitated toward them.
After some exhaustive searching, I picked up the last webcam available in the North-west Austin area.
At least it feels that way.</p>
<p>Currently, I mount my monitor using an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079YQQDT2">AmazonBasics arm mount</a>.
At first, I was excited to use it.
Over time, it hasn&rsquo;t held up well and is starting to show some strain.
I&rsquo;ve been looking for a new one, but it&rsquo;s tempting to unmount and go back to the stand.</p>
<p>To keep my laptop level with the screen, it rests on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P54RSPY">Nuxaly laptop stand</a>.
This gives it a few inches underneath allowing for better circulation when things get hot and heavy.
Since it&rsquo;s raised, I needed a mouse and keyboard.
Luckily I had a few around.
My keyboard is a 2013 <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/Razer-BlackWidow-Tournament-Edition-Chroma-V2/RZ03-02190700-R3M1">Razer BlackWidow Tournament Edition</a>.
While it&rsquo;s not back-lit like the linked chroma edition, the model I link is more or less the same.
I used an Apple TrackPad for a little while, and finally broke down for a more responsive mouse.
I wound up buying the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/Razer-Basilisk-X-HyperSpeed/RZ01-03150100-R3U1">Razer Basilisk X HyperSpeed</a> mouse.
The mouse can be connected wirelessly or using bluetooth.
It has a handful of programmable buttons and is comfortable ot hold in your hand.
While I was skeptical about a gaming mouse pad at first, I&rsquo;ve come to enjoy the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-mouse-mats/Razer-Goliathus-Mobile-Stealth-Edition/RZ02-01820500-R3M1">Razer Goliathus Mobile Stealth</a>.
It&rsquo;s thin and lightweight making it easy to travel with, when that&rsquo;s a thing again.
The thing that caught my eye about the mouse pad is the anti-fray aspect.
Many of my previous mouse pads wore down and frayed at the edge making them difficult to use.</p>
<p>Finally, I connect a pair of <a href="https://www.cowinaudio.com/collections/active-noise-cancelling-headphones/products/cowin-e7-noise-cancelling-headphone?variant=8261760221235">Cowin E7 active noise cancelling headphones</a>.
At a $60 price point, it&rsquo;s hard to argue with these.
You get great sound for a pretty reasonable price.</p>
<h3 id="cluster-hardware">Cluster hardware</h3>
<p><img src="/statics/img/2020-10-19-clusters.jpeg" alt="clusters"></p>
<p>While independent of my desk, I consider my cluster(s) part of my setup.
I have full access to them and am able to send work to them when I need to.
Because of their specifications, I largely leverage them for parallel processing.
As shown, I have 3 racks each with the same specifications.
I give each rack a <code>/29</code> to allow for growth.
Each rack contains the following hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>1x <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-4?variant=29157087445075">Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB model)</a></li>
<li>4x <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-b-plus">Raspberry Pi 3b+</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/GeauxRobot-Raspberry-Model-5-layer-Enclosure/dp/B01D90TX1O">GeauxRobot 5-Layer DogBone Rack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerPort-iPhone-Galaxy/dp/B00P936188">Anker 60W power supply</a></li>
<li>Heat sinks</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked more in depth about how I set up the cluster in previous posts.
But the gist is that each rack acts as an &ldquo;availability zone&rdquo;.
This helps give me control over the placement of my workloads as well as test out features.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>I primarily use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a> for active development.
While I mostly write in Golang, I&rsquo;ve been a long time subscriber to IntelliJ.
While there are other language specific versions from IntelliJ, their architecture allows you to cross-install plugins.
The things I like most about IntelliJ is their code intelligence.
When implementing a feature, I can click through to function implementations, go to definitions, show inheritance, you name it.</p>
<p>If I need to modify something quickly, I&rsquo;ll use a simpler piece of software like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>.
While not as feature rich as IntelliJ, it does provide enough for me to get familiar with a project or investigate an issue.
There are a lot of times I&rsquo;m working in VSCode where I wish I had some more powerful capabilities.</p>
<p>Since I spend a lot of time working on Kubernetes and surrounding tooling, I&rsquo;ll often run a cluster locally.
I often do this one of two ways: using <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/">minikube</a> with the docker driver or <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/">kind</a>.
Both approaches will spin up a cluster in my well sized <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/">Docker4Mac</a> instance.
While the full feature set of kubernetes isn&rsquo;t available, I have enough to work with locally.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope y&rsquo;all enjoyed a quick peak at my setup.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
Cheers!</p>
