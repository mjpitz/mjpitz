followers and deactivated it. Before deactivation, I created a new account and invited folks to follow me there. This
not only gave me a fresh start, but it also gave me a chance to curate who I follow and who I allow to follow me a bit
better than I had before. After having it up for a few months, I finally decided to deactivate it. For good. Here&rsquo;s why,
and how my life has been better because of it.</p></p></div>

        </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="post-content"><div class="p_part"><p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t happen a lot, but every so often I come across a device that isn&rsquo;t wi-fi supported.
This latest case was my security system.
On one hand, I like that my cameras aren&rsquo;t taking up bandwidth on my home network and that the system is largely a closed loop.
On the other, not having access to my security system without having it tethered into the router is a bit of a pain.
For one, my home networking setup isn&rsquo;t that elegant (yet).
Second, the last thing I want to do is have more stuff out in the open, co-located with my router.
So I decided to get a little creative.
Sure, I could&rsquo;ve bought a wi-fi adapter, but where&rsquo;s the fun in that.
On top of that, I had some other reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t want to spend money on an adapter for this system.
Even though they aren&rsquo;t that expensive, I would likely need to wait for one to come in which would probably happen <em>after</em> I left for my trip.</li>
<li>Eventually, I want to do some real-time video processing and having a device closer to the box is promising.
This would let me process data straight from the box rather than needing to transmit all that information over wi-fi to another machine.</li>
<li>Finally, I already have more than a dozen pis around.
For the first version of this, I wound up using a 3b+.
I would likely upgrade this later on when I add the real-time processing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Today, I show how I set up and configured a Raspberry Pi to act as a WAN client for a connected device.</p></p></div>

    <div class="post-content"><div class="p_part"><p><p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve found myself using <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> for more of the projects that I work on.
Redis can be used in a variety of ways.
It provides functionality for queueing, set operations, bitmaps, streams, and so much more.
Yet, most of my experience with Redis has been as a best-effort cache.
Since it&rsquo;s become a staple in my development, I figured it would be good to brush up on its operations.</p>
<p>In this post, I dive into the variety of ways Redis can be deployed.
I&rsquo;ll cover the benefits, tradeoffs, and even some uses for each deployment.
Finally, I&rsquo;ll describe the deployment that I recently put together.</p></p></div>

        </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="post-content"><div class="p_part"><p><p>Every engineering organization struggles to stay up to date with the latest versions of applications they run.
When an organization deploys an open source project, their versions start to drift from day one.
The longer a project runs without an update, the more likely it is to contain a vulnerability.
To help applications stay on top of library versions, the project <a href="https://github.com/renovatebot/">Renovate</a> was developed.
Renovate works by parsing manifest files (like <code>package.json</code> and <code>go.mod</code>) and checking for newer versions of libraries.
When Renovate discovers an update, it submits a pull request with the newer version to the project.</p>
<p>Recently, I noticed Renovate submit pull requests for dependencies in my <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> v3 charts.
This gave me an idea.
What if Renovate could automatically manage something like a GitOps repository?
This means organizations would no longer need to tediously query for newer versions of applications.
Instead, they&rsquo;d automatically receive a pull request when an update becomes available.
In this blog post, I demonstrate how to set this up for an <a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/">ArgoCD</a> GitOps repository.</p></p></div>

It wasn&rsquo;t until September that this started to be possible.
<a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/releases/tag/stable-2.9.0">Linkerd</a> recently released support for arm64, but has had support for it in edge versions since August.
Many <a href="https://envoyproxy.io/">envoy</a> based service mesh have been blocked by support for an arm-compatible envoy image.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a> is a powerful service discovery and configuration management tool from <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/">Hashicorp</a>.
It has a long history of supporting a variety of execution platforms, operating systems, and architectures.
In 1.2, Hashicorp introduced <a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/connect">Consul Connect</a>, an envoy based service mesh integration.
This allows Consul to control and direct clients in the service mesh data plane.</p>
<p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll demonstrate how to deploy Consul to support a service mesh on Raspberry Pis.</p></p></div>

From hobbyists to open core ecosystems, projects are trying to find ways insulate their users.
For my projects, I chose to deploy a simple registry mirror.
One nice thing about this project is that the system is largely stateless (and cheap to run).
The <code>docker-registry</code> and <code>docker-auth</code> projects are horizontally scalable.
The only stateful system you really need to manage is a cache (which isn&rsquo;t mission critical).
While <a href="https://goharbor.io/">Harbor</a> was appealing, it had a lot more overhead than what I needed.
In this post, I&rsquo;ll walk you through my deployment.</p></p></div>

Unfortunately these tools are limited in their capabilities, namely a lack of load balancer support.
As a result, the community developed solutions like <a href="https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd">kubefwd</a> and <code>minikube tunnel</code> to expose services.
While this approach works, keeping a dedicated terminal open during development can be tedeous.
In this post, I show how to set up an ingress controller in a kind cluster and pair it with a private, locally addressable domain.</p></p></div>
