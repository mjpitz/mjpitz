<br/>

I'm an Engineering Director at [CrabNebula][], one of the organizations behind the [Tauri][] project.

Outside of work, I'm an avid hockey player, piano player, a parent to both humans and pets, and I volunteer for a
state-wide search and rescue organization. Like many, I struggle with a wide range of mental health issues and rely
heavily on screen readers. Over the last few months, I've been out on [FMLA][], but am excited and enthusiastic to
return back to work.

### Preferred Languages

[Go]: https://go.dev
[Rust]: https://rust-lang.org

When it comes to programming languages, I fall into the camp of "use the right tool for the job". Since starting my 
career on the front-end development side of the world, I'm fluent with JavaScript, NodeJS, TypeScript, and many other 
variants we've seen throughout the years. Since then, I've picked up a few more systems programming languages, including
[Go][] and [Rust][].

### Observability, Operations, and Intelligence

[cognative]: https://github.com/mjpitz/cognative
[ClickHouse]: https://clickhouse.com
[OpenTelemetry]: https://opentelemetry.io
[Grafana]: https://grafana.com

I recently adopted [cognative][], a simplified stack that I've been developing to reduce the technical requirements for
smaller organizations to own their own Business Intelligence and Operations (what I'm calling BIO). It does this by
collapsing the traditional "Business Intelligence" and "Operations" verticals into a single, common stack that offers a
centralized location for ALL your information.

Cognative is composed of three systems: [ClickHouse][], [OpenTelemetry][], and [Grafana][].

### Runtime and Orchestration

[Kubernetes]: https://kubernetes.io
[k3s]: https://k3s.io
[Aurae]: https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae

Over the last 6 years, I've accumulated a lot of experience operating [Kubernetes][] clusters in production, overseeing
large scale migrations to the platform, as well as having hands-on experience deploying and maintaining systems running
on it. For smaller projects where a cloud provider may not be available, I enjoy the [k3s][] ecosystem. Outside 
Kubernetes, I'm really interested in going a bit deeper on the [Aurae][] project to explore it's potential for 
small-board systems.

### Deployment

[ArgoCD]: https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
[Terraform]: https://terraform.io
[Helm]: https://helm.sh

Deploying systems to production is always fun. I have been a big fan of the [ArgoCD][] project for a while but found it
to be a bit overkill for the cases I'm in these days. For now, I just rely on [Terraform][] to drive [Helm][] releases,
but look forward to being able to leverage ArgoCD once again.

### Passion Projects

[Raspberry Pi]: https://raspberrypi.com
[Fujifilm X-T20]: https://a.co/d/10mKXwR

In general, small-board computer projects (such as the [Raspberry Pi][]) make me really excited about possible
opportunities. I've always enjoyed tinkering with things throughout my life and the Raspberry Pi is a great tool to do
just that. And finally, I like to take photos for the projects I'm working on (especially when hardware is involved). So
I recently bought a [Fujifilm X-T20][] and have been absolutely loving it.
